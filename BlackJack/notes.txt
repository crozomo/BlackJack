Need a way to read handSize() -FIXED 
Need a way to draw a new subsequent card. currently, due to the loop, it adds 2 cards on hit - FIXED
Need a way to display 2 starting cards for the player - FIXED
    - print the cards outside of the while loop?
    - have the random card getting outside of the loop while only having HSD inside the loop?


Dec 8 2025
need to fix current linear operations - it sometimes goes bust then shows player wins - FIXED
add dealer getting new cards when its their turn - dealeractions loop? - FIXED
when standing, if player > dealer, it jumps straight to player wins - FIXED
now when standing, it boots back to menu, losing the bet - FIXED
when player > dealer, shows player wins but then exits program. - FIXED
when player busts, moves to dealer actions rather than exiting current game - FIXED
turn win/loss conditions into their own functions, to call in if functions?
    - if player = bust, dealerturn = false etc

dealer busts, then dealer wins? - FIXED
find some way to exit back to betting screen, once game is over, rather than exit to main menu
    - currently game and betting screen is within the GAME BLOCK
player busts (>21), dealer takes cards, >=17 || >= 21, player wins (as player > dealer) - FIXED
deck size is not resetting - FIXED
if player doubles, but result is push, money is deducted anyway

need to find some way to override dealer turn if player busts/BJs - FIXED
when getting a new card which leads to player bust/BJ, 
        need a way to update card display before outputting result -FIXED

Betting screen needs exit conditions

using ascii card art, they are displayed:
      .------.
      |9 ^   |
      | / \  |
      | \ /  |
      |  v  9|
      '------'
      .------.
      |6 ^   |
      | / \  |
      | \ /  |
      |  v  6|
      '------'
Need to find a way to make them display horizontally
    - either that or find a way to keep game menu and info in the center
Like so:
dealer              player
card    hit         card
card    stand       card
        double      card
isnt this just the same as trying to print cards horizontally
    - or just play in full screen i guess

give player input after win/loss condition instead of timer? - done
