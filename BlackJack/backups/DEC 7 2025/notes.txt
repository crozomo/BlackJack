Need a way to read handSize()
Need a way to draw a new subsequent card. currently, due to the loop, it adds 2 cards on hit
Need a way to display 2 starting cards for the player
    - print the cards outside of the while loop?
    - have the random card getting outside of the loop while only having HSD inside the loop?
